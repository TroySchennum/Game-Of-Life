# Game-Of-Life

Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science classic from 1970, a program that simulates a cellular automaton (plural automata). It has connections to all kinds of different aspects of computer science and nature.

Over the course of this week, students will work on creating their own application in which users will be able to run different "Game of Life" scenarios. This module leads the reader through the fundamentals of Conways's "Game of Life" and will guide them through the process of creating an app utilizing tools and frameworks that have been taught over the course of their specific track.
